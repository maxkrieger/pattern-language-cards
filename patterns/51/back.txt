On local roads, closed to through traffic, plant grass all over the road and set occasional paving stones into the grass to form a surface for the wheels of those cars that need access to the street. Make no distinction between street and, sidewalk. Where houses open off the street, put in more paving stones or gravel to let cars turn onto their own land.
