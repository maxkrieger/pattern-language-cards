Encourage a birth and death process for towns within the region, which gradually has these effects:  1. The population is evenly distributed in terms of different sizes- example, one town with 1,000,000 people, 10 towns with 100,000 people each, 100 towns with 10,000 people each, and 1000 towns with 1000 people each.  2. These towns are distributed in space in such a way that within each size category the towns are homogeneously distributed all across the region.
