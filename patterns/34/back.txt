At every interchange in the web of transportation follow these principles: 1. Surround the interchange with workplaces and housing types which specially need public transportation. 2. Keep the interior of the interchange continuous with the exterior pedestrian network, and maintain this continuity by building in small shops and kiosks and by keeping parking to one side. 3. Keep the transfer distance between different modes of transport down to 300 feet wherever possible, with an absolute maximum of 600 feet.
