Separate neighboring subcultures with a swath of land at least 200 feet wide. Let this boundary be natural wilderness, farmland, water - or man-made - railroads, major roads, parks, schools, some housing. Along the seam between two subcultures, build meeting places, shared functions, touching each community.
