Give every neighborhood at least one corner grocery, somewhere near its heart. Place these corner groceries every 200 to 8oo yards, according to the density, so that each one serves about 1000 people. Place them on corners, where large numbers of people are going past. And combine them with houses, so that the people who run them can live over them or next to them.
