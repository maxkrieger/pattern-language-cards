Make the traveler's inn a place where travelers can take rooms for the night, but where - unlike most hotels and motels - the inn draws all its energy from the community of travelers that are there any given evening. The scale is small - 30 or 40 guests to an inn; meals are offered communally; there is even a large space ringed round with beds in alcoves.
