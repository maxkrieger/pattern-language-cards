Give each member of the family a room of his own, especially adults. A minimum room of one's own is an alcove with desk, shelves, and curtain. The maximum is a cottage - like a Teenager's Cottage (154), or an Old Age Cottage (155). In all cases, especially the adult ones, place these rooms at the far ends of the intimacy gradient - far from the common rooms.
