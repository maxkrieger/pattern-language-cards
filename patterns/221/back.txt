On no account use standard doors or windows. Make each window a different size, according to its place. Do not fix the exact position or size of the door and window frames until the rough framing of the room has actually been built, and you can really stand inside the room and judge, by eye, exactly where you want to put them, and how big you want them. When you decide, mark the openings with strings. Make the windows smaller and smaller, as you go higher in the building.
