Set up processes which encourage groups of 8 to 12 people to come together and establish communal households. Morphologically, the important things are: 1. Private realms for the groups and individuals that make up the extended family: couple's realms, private rooms, sub-households for small families. 2. Common space for shared functions: cooking, working, gardening, child care. 3. At the important crossroads of the site, a place where the entire group can meet and sit together.
