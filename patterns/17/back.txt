Place high speed roads (freeways and other major arteries) so that:  1. At least one high speed road lies tangent to each local transport area.  2. Each local transport area has at least one side not bounded by a high speed road' but directly open to the countryside. 3. The road is always sunken, or shielded along its length by berms, or earth, or industrial buildings, to protect the nearby neighborhoods from noise.
